<h2>Topic 1: Characteristics of Fake News</h2> 

<h3>Datasets:</h3>

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news">Getting Real About Fake News</a>

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/news-aggregator-dataset">News Aggregator Dataset</a>

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can a search engine provider or social media platform do something to combat the fake news epidemic by automatically flagging suspect articles?</li>
<li>Are there specific words, punctuation marks, or other indicators that appear more often in fake news articles, as opposed to real or unbiased news articles?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcomes:</h3>
<p>Ideally, I'd like to produce a program that can accurately predict whether an article is fake news or legitimate news.</p>


<h3>Potential Problems:</h3>

<ul>
<li>One of the quickest ways of proving something is fake news is to check the story against a fact checker website such as Snopes -- I'm not sure if that's within the scope of things we'll learn in the workshop?</li>
<li>The fake news dataset doesn't contain any real news stories -- so I'm hoping that I can use News Aggregator Dataset from 2014 as a source of real news stories.</li>
</ul>
