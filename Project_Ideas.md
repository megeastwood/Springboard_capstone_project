<h2>Topic 1: Characteristics of Fake News</h2> 

<h3>Datasets:</h3>

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news">Getting Real About Fake News</a>

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/news-aggregator-dataset">News Aggregator Dataset</a>

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can a search engine provider or social media platform do something to combat the fake news epidemic by automatically flagging suspect articles?</li>
<li>Are there specific words, punctuation marks, or other indicators that appear more often in fake news articles, as opposed to real or unbiased news articles?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcomes:</h3>
<p>Ideally, I'd like to produce a program that can accurately predict whether an article is fake news or legitimate news.</p>


<h3>Potential Problems:</h3>

<ul>
<li>One of the quickest ways of proving something is fake news is to check the story against a fact checker website such as Snopes -- I'm not sure if that's within the scope of things we'll learn in the workshop?</li>
<li>The fake news dataset doesn't contain any real news stories -- so I'm hoping that I can use News Aggregator Dataset from 2014 as a source of real news stories.</li>
</ul>
<br></br>

<h2>Topic 2: Exploring Forest Data</h2>

<h3>Datasets:</h3>

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset">Forest Cover Type Dataset</a>


<h3>Questions:</h3>

<p>I studied biology as an undergraduate, so I'd love to work with biological data for my capstone. I haven't come up with any new questions for this dataset, but I did like the "Inspiration" questions listed with the dataset on Kaggle:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Can you build a model that predicts what types of trees grow in an area based on the surrounding characteristics?"</li>
<li>"What kinds of trees are most common in the Roosevelt National Forest?"</li>
<li>"Which tree types can grow in more diverse environments? Are there certain tree types that are sensitive to an environmental factor, such as elevation or soil type?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential Problems:</h3>
<p>The first question was actually a challenge question on kaggle at one point, so I fear answering that question might be beyond the scope of this capstone project.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>Topic 3: An Author By Any Other Name</h2>

<h3>Datasets:</h3>

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays">Shakespeare Plays</a>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Does a comparison of the language in each Shakespeare play support the idea that Shakespeare was one author? Or does it support the idea that Shakespeare was a pseudonym that covered several different authors?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcomes:</h3>

<p>A general linguistic profile each play, that allows you to compare lunguistic/writing style between plays.</p>

<h3>Potential Problems:</h3>

<p>Once again, I have no idea how feasible this would be as a capstone project. Also, I know this topic has been done to death, but I still find it interesting ;)</p>
